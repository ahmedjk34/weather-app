## Basic Idea

A weather application where users can search for and view real-time weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and forecasts. The app will allow users to input a city name or use their current location to get weather details. Data will be fetched from the OpenWeatherAPI, providing accurate and up-to-date weather conditions, forecasts, and additional metrics like chance of rain and humidity.
